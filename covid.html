<h2>The Experience COVID Gave Me</h2>
<section>
  <p>Everyday experiences are never noticed until it is taken away from us. Due to the situation that we are currently facing, a lot of things are getting carried away from us. This coronavirus situation took away something that I do every day, and I never realized how important it was to me, and that was walking outside. Every day, I go out to take a walk, to give myself a moment of a refresher, a moment to relax. I never took that action into consideration since it was just a habit, and I never realized how important it is to me. Walking outside gives me the enjoyment of the outside, what a place we live in, and it makes me feel very relaxed. Any type of meandering strolls around my neighborhood is calming because the wind takes you and you feel free. I go wherever my visceral feelings are pointing me towards, it's a journey. The soothing breeze, the clear sky, the air is cold, yet I feel warm. I would walk outside at any time of the day; however, I preferably like walking out during the night. I feel more immersed in the environment surrounding me. The sky is black, but the subtle hints of the white light in the sky are beautiful, the views across the city are really something to admire during the night, I resonated with the calm vibe of the people, the faint wind on my face was relaxing, and the unavoidable car horns were relatively annoying. After it was announced that all schools were closed until April 20, there was almost no one on the streets, there were no cars, businesses were closed, and the subtle change in the wind gave me goosebumps. The wind was not relaxed and delicate, it became drastically colder and became more substantial, it made me feel uneasy. I went to go shopping the day after it was announced and there were many clothing shops that I passed by that were closed, I was only hearing my footsteps, and I realized how different New York City became due to the COVID-19 situation. It was a few days later that there were more cases of the coronavirus that my mom decided to let no one leave and go outside. The only thing I was able to do was to stay inside with my family; however, this situation gave me a fantastic chance for me to bond with my family more. Since I always used to go outside, I barely talk with my family, but due to the situation we were in, our bond was stronger than ever. However, this isolation does make me feel uneasy since I can’t go outside anymore, I can’t experience the wind anymore, and I won’t be able to appreciate the city we live in. Something that I used to do every day was taken away from me in an instant, and I never wanted to go outside more than ever
