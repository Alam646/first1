  <h2>The Community I Live In</h2>
  <section>
  <p>I admire the diversity of my community, where all types of people can live together with no sort of discrimination between the neighbors. The kindness and compassion we all share with the neighbors, seeing person before color. However, what I want to change in my community is the excessive amount of police on the streets. As I walk around the predominantly white neighborhoods, there are no cops at every block, even though the bodegas report many accounts of theft, there is barely any police activity near. There have also been false arrests in my neighborhood for “suspicious activity”, and there are frequent stops and searches on people in my neighborhood due to “suspicious activity” again. It's during these times I get infuriated, that the communities that are diverse are the ones to get attacked by the law, that’s what I want to stop, the discrimination within my community. The police should be more mindful of our background differences and cultural sensitivity. We also need police that are willing to help, become more immersed in the community, starting with the creation of community partnerships, helping to establish relationships where there is tension, and they can gladly volunteer in our neighborhood.   </p>
