<div>Hey Abidul, </div>
<p>It’s been a long time since we’ve talked, like talking to yourself is pretty common but having a formal conversation like this is rare. I just hope you’re doing well, right now, my future is pretty undetermined, I might be the valedictorian of this school, but y’know, the odds can be against me, hopefully, I get my 2 cents like my uncle said he would, if I’m valedictorian that is. I hope I studied rigorously for my AP exams and my SHSAT, getting 1500 on my SHSAT and at least a 4 or a 5 on my ap exams, I hope I’m academically successful, I hope I didn’t stress a lot, reaching the goals I wanted, I hope I have been helping my friends who helped me. I also hope that I still have my friend, like Justin, Ethan, Philip, Chris, and much more beside me while we grow together. 2020 was hell, forget the virus, I have been so unproductive and it just sucks, but I believe I have been going on the right track so far. I wish this school was just better y’know, well hey, at least the college I might be currently in or I graduated from is a top-tier university/college. I also hope my family members are still with me as well, as they have been a huge help, especially my parents I hope my little was able to study a lot more for his SHSAT, hopefully from the start of 2021, I hope he understands the importance of education, he is doing what I was doing as a child, and that can take him to the wrong path, I wish I was able to help him in upcoming months. I hope coronavirus is gone from the world, it was ruining my life, I was supposed to study abroad in Morocco but that was canceled, I at least wish to attend NOLS in the summer of 2021, but yeah, that’s what I want, and that’s how I have been. What’s going on with you Abidul? </p>
<div>Regards, You know who </div>
