  <p>My response simply cannot be written in a few sentences. There are times when my characteristics are universal, but there are also times my characteristics can be considered rare. I like to see myself as a student that doesn’t do too much, and that isn’t considered to be a good thing. I question all of the actions I do. Should I be typing up this response for HW? Why did this task take me an hour to complete? Am I really smart enough? Will I pass these exams? Have I been studying enough? I am the type to ask questions, yet, I would never have an answer for them. For someone that is seen as “organized” and “focused”, I don’t see myself as that. I’m just following the rules, where a lot of people tend not to, to enjoy their “freedom”, but these “rules” are telling me what to do. Where would I be able to go without any rules? It’s times like these that worry me, however, it’s something I use to my advantage. Society right now is all about norms, where rules are just bound to be followed, but it's not as if I can’t be free. There were times I have been lost without rules, but I had friends around me to support me. Studying for exams was never something everyone knew how to do, my way of studying was excruciatingly rigorous. I was stubborn, thinking this was the only way I was able to learn. There were times I was asked if I needed help; however, I simply declined their help as I was cocky and ignorant. This only made me more stressed and tired but I still thought over-studying was my only solution.
One day, I was walking with two of my best friends to our usual hangout place during lunch, a Japanese supermarket where we would eat sushi.
As we walked up to the mezzanine, we saw the pillars lifting the roof. “Hey, aren’t these pillars like us? We support one another, the roof is whenever someone is stressed and those pillars are the two of us. That’s kinda cool. Also, you gotta support yourself here and there.”
This statement enlightened me as we laughed together. Later that day when walking back home, I realized there was never one man standing on his own if he is surrounded by others. I realized that all this time, I kept stressing alone even though there were others around me willing to support me. I remembered that I had friends around me that have similar goals, share the same work ethic, and also study for a dreadful amount of hours. After that day, we started to use our group chat more where we came to realize that we understood each other. My friends became my pillars.  After that day, I started to study with my friends in the library for several hours after school, and it was way different from studying alone for hours at home. The sense of isolation and deprivation was not there anymore.  I was in an environment where I became more humble and I wasn’t afraid to ask for support. I used to study until I “passed out”, however, I now studied until I learned enough, and it’s a lot easier to learn with a group of supportive friends. Spending my time wisely was not just studying, understanding the people around me,  providing the support they needed, and realizing that I was never all alone in anything.
